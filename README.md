# Plover Sokutaipu EX

A Japanese stenography system for Plover.

## Activating Sokutaipu EX

After installing this plugin, you need to turn it on in Plover:

1. In Plover's configuration, go to the ``Systems`` tab, and change the active system to ``Plover_Sokutoipu_EX``.
2. You can use Qwerty keyboard to use this theory.
   I recommend to use keyboards which have more than two thumb keys.(space, and more)
